## Problem Statement

The [Rabbit Ears Corkscrew](https://www.rabbitwine.com/the-original-rabbit-corkscrew.html) is a fine piece of engineering and is genuinely a useful labour-saving device for opening bottles of wine. (Non-disclaimer - Contributors to this project have no financial (or other) interest in the company that manufactures this device).  However, it has a couple of weaknesses:
- The corkscrew itself may wear out.  Fortunately replacements are readily available online.
- There is a plastic part that holds the screw which can crack, causing the whole device to be useless.  Exhausitve online searches have not yielded a source of replacements of this part.

As far as is known, there is no specific name for this part.  From now on it shall be refered to it as a *Rabbit Ears Corkscrew Bushing*, or just a *bushing*.

## Solution

The aim of this project is to reverse-engineer the bushing such that it may be readily available to users of 3D printers, and easily installed in Rabit Ears Corkscrews where the original bushing has failed.  This project has the following goals:

- Measure an original bushing
- Use measurements to create a 3d model of the part
- Render 3d model into some format suitable for sending to a 3d printer
- Document instructions for replacement of bushing
